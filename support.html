                            <p>We prioritize user safety in Prayer Partner matching by ensuring age-appropriate, faith-centered connections. Users aged 14-17 can only be matched with other users aged 14-17, and users 18+ can only be matched with other users 18+. These private, anonymous connections have no photos‚Äîjust faithful hearts connecting through shared spiritual focus. The Community Hub and Prayer Wall are accessible to all users, and everyone has the ability to report any concerning content or behavior.</p>
